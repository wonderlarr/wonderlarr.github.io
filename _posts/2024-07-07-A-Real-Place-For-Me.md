# I put together a website
I learned a lot about web frameworks and stuff, turns out making websites yourself is a lot easier than I thought and doesn't involve writing HTML, CSS, and other crap yourself. Works for me. I'm using Jekyll here to generate a static site for GitHub Pages, my host. After a few days I have this half complete website, which I will probably leave incomplete for a while till it matters more.
